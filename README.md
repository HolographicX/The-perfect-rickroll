# The-perfect-rickroll

This simple code, when executed, prints the first 6 lines of "Never gonna give you up" and then opens up Crome and plays the Never gonna YouTube video

For this to work, you wil need:
Python,
Selenium, and 
Pip

You'll also need the chromedriver.exe in the folder you run this script in for your browser to open Chrome.

To run the script just type "python rr.py" in the Command Prompt

That's it, the Never Gonna lyrics is encoded so that no one will suspect a rickroll until they run the script in the Command prompt.
